First project for CompSci 308 Fall 2016

This is a simple dodging/flying game. The user directs the ship, attempting to avoid the incoming blocks and make it as far as possible. If the user collides with a block, he loses a life.

There are also circular tokens that can change the ship's color. If the ship has color, colliding with a block of that color actually gives the player an extra life.

At certain benchmarks scores, the user enters a "bonus round" in which the object reversesâ€“he must try to hit as many blocks as possible in the short amount of time, gaining points as he does so. All blocks are fair game, regardless of color.

Cheat codes: 
*UP: Speed up how often lines of blocks are generated.

-DOWN: Slow down generation of lines of blocks.

-NUMBERS 1-6: Mimic picking up of respective colors: RED, YELLOW, BLUE, GREEN, ORANGE, PURPLE.

-B: Enter bonus round immediately.
